# Description

Crafting of Very Important Draughts (COVID for short) is a 2D reaction puzzle mobile game. 
The goal is to craft various arcane potions per the instructions of a master healer, whose apprentice you are. 
The master will guide you through the increasingly difficult levels with black sarcasm and the occasionally funny joke. 
The game becomes the harder the more advanced in medical alchemy you become, the ingredients falling more numerous and swiftly along with the harmful objects to be avoided. 
Being a healer is a responsible position in the community, so it goes without saying that training to become one will be merciless and unforgiving.
